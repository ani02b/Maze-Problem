# problem
The problem is that an AI agent is inside a maze standing in the start position and it wants to find its way to goal. Maze is given as a text file.
# approach
Here three searching algorithms i.e. Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search and Uniform Cost Search are used to find the path.
Also it will display the running time for each algorithm. Moreover some more files containing different mazes are there which are used as test cases.
